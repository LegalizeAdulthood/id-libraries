FractInt Contest Images
(c) by Jay Hill, 1997
Version 3.1, 01/24/1998

The images were created by subscribers of The Fractint Discussion List.
Administrator: Timothy Wegner.

The FractInt image contest finished at Midnight PST on December 5.
The members of The FractInt Discussion List then voted on the "Top Ten"
best images from all submissions, followed by another vote on the best
three to be the actual "Winners".   Each entry is a PAR file which,
when used with FractInt, creates 3 images based on a special contest
formula file.   In the table below, each row shows the corresponding
entries by the person submitting the PAR file, which is pointed to
in the first column by the blue "P"'.   Images are reductions of the
"real" images the artists created (please recreate your own in
1024x768 or better resolution).   Download the current Contest Kit.
