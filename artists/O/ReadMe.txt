Why I call myself O.

Most people think of Chaos as the opposite of Order, but actually Order
is merely Chaos constrained.   In this respect, Order and Chaos form a
continuum that comprises the fullness of existence.   The opposite of
this "fullness" is the "nothingness" or a Void, often represented by an
empty circle.

As O, I play Yin to Chaos' Yang in bringing forth images that display
the fullness of Chaos.

All these images were created with a freeware fractal program called
Fractint, using only its standard built-in formulae.   In keeping with the
spirit of its developers, I have not encrypted these images or tried to
make them "proprietary" in any way so that others may learn and improve
upon the techniques I have used.

Most of these images have been posted to the Usenet Newsgroup
alt.binaries.pictures.fractals, where one may find my newer works from
time to time.   While this art is my gift to the world (for the many gifts
it has given me), I ask that those who wish to make commercial use of it
honor the copyright and pay the appropriate fees (which are similar to
those charged by photographers).   All proceeds will be used to establish
various artist's sites, so that they may bring you other artwork.

If you would like further information, or have comments, please send me
an Email.
