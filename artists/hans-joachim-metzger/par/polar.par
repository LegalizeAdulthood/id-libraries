Polar Curves

Typically, points in a plane are thought of in terms of their x- and
y-coordinates, that is, how far away (and on which side) the point is
from the horizontal x-axis and the vertical y-axis.  Another way of
looking at the point is with polar coordinates, which specify the
distance of the point from the origin (r) and its direction (t).  The
two methods are equivalent:

x = r*cos(t), y=r*sin(t), or
r^2 = x^2 + y^2, tan(t) = y/x.

Polar curves are curves that specify r as a function of t, instead of
y as a function of x.  The curve used in this coloring method is:

r = [a * f(b*t)]^n + r0,

where f is one of Fractint's builtin functions (e.g., sin, cos, exp,
etc.), a is an amplitude scaling factor, and b is a frequency factor.
The exponent n is useful for making the curve wider or thinner, and r0
is a expansion or contraction constant.

Some special curves can be generated using this function.  Spirals can
be made by using the "ident" function.  Here, the exponent n controls
how tightly wound the spiral is.  However, only one revolution of the
spiral will be drawn, as t is limited to the range 0 to 2*pi.

"Rose" curves are made by using either sin or cos functions.  The
parameter a controls the size of the curve.  The number of "petals"
is b, so long as b is a positive integer.  Increasing n from 1 will
make the petals thinner; decreasing it toward 0 will make them thicker.
Leave r0=0 for the standard rose curve, where the petals all join at
the origin.

Since the sin and cos functions generate negative values, the "rose"
curves will have some regions of negative r.  How this is handled
depends on r0 and "negrflag", the negative r flag.  Setting negrflag to
1 will make the routine ignore negative r values.  This, with r0 is set
to 0, will cause the rose curve to have "b" number of petals, all of
them the same size.  Setting negrflag=2 will make the routine consider
negative r's the same as positive r's.  Thus, the rose curve will have
2*b petals.  Increasing r0 from 0 will make r positive more often than
negative.  This will also increase the number of petals from b to 2*b,
but half of the petals will be small and half will be large.

The best way to see the effects of the parameter choices is to use the
"polar" formula.  This formula doesn't draw a fractal, just the polar
curve determined by a, b, n, r0, the chosen function, and the negative r
flag.  Another flag determines how the curve is shown.  If the coloring
flag "colflag" is set to 1, then the image will be colored by how close
the pixel is to the polar curve.  Is essence, this will outline the curve.
If colflag=2, then the area outside of the curve is colored black (color
0), and the inside is rendered in a second color (color 40).

The other formulas use polar curves to color fractals.  There are 2
basic rendering methods:  how close the orbit comes to the polar curve,
and how often the orbit is inside the polar curve.  The "polar-near_man"
and "polar-near_jul" formulas color the Mandelbrot and Julia sets in the
first manner.  The "polar-inout_man" and "polar-inout_jul" formulas take
the second tack.  In the Julia cases, the bailout value and the negative
r flag are hardcoded, to allow full freedom in specifying a, b, n, and r0.
