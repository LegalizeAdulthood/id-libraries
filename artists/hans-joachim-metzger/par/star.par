SeeingStars

Mostfractal images involve circles in some respect:  either stopping
theiteration when the orbit moves outside of a given circle, or
coloringby how close the orbit comes to a certain circle, or some
variation.These formulas use a 5 point star instead of a circle.
The"starnear" formulas color by how close the orbit comes to a star.
The"starbail" formulas are set up to stop iterating either when the
orbitcomes into a star or when it leaves a star.

Thestar is represented by the 5 outer points.  These are equally spaced
ona circle.  The center and size of the circle are user-specified, as
isthe rotation angle of the star.

Howz at any iteration relates to the star (inside, outside, how close)
isdetermined by looking at each of the 10 sides, one at a time.  Each
sidecan be represented by a line A*x + B*y + C = 0, where A, B, and C
comefrom the coordinates of the 2 outer points that are joined to make
theside.  Given the numbers A, B, and C, the quantity

q = A*real(z) + B*imag(z) + C

iscomputed.  If q is positive, then z is on one side of the line, and
ifq is negative, then z is on the other side of the line.  If |q| is
verysmall, that means that z is very close to that side of the star.
Takingthe signs of q for all 10 sides will determine if z is inside or
outsideof the star.  Using the smallest value of |q| gives the distance
fromz to the star.

Tosee this in action, use the formula "star".  It will draw the outline
ofa star, with the position, orientation and size that you choose.
Thisformula, and the "starnear" formulas that are built on it, use a
logarithmictransfer function from distance to angle (for decomposition
coloringin Fractint).  This helps highlight the star without needing to
findout if the point is exactly on the star or not.  The "star-inout"
formulawill draw a star in 2 colors.  Everything inside the star is one
color,and everything outside of the star is the other color.  These 2
formulasare simply to give an idea of how the method works.

Thefractal formulas need a bit of extra explanation.  In the
"starnear_jul"formula, you have the option of whether or not to check
thepixel (initial value of z) for its distance from the star.  If the
staris centered at the origin (p2=0/0), this can make quite a difference.
Forexample, use the "starnear2" parameter set.  As written, the real
partof p3 is -0.28. The magnitude of real(p3) is the radius of the circle
containingthe 5 outer points.  If real(p3) is negative, that tells the
formulato check the pixel for its distance before iterating.  In the
image,this shows up as a star in the center.  Now, make real(p3) +0.28.
You'llsee that the outer portion of the image is unchanged, but the star
inthe middle has gone away.  In the "starbail" formulas, the flag to
checkthe pixel before iterating (pixelflag) has been set in the formula,
andis not interactively changeable (too many parameters).

The"starnear" formulas use a standard bailout condition--stop when the
iterategets too big, or leaves a very large circle.  Conversely, in the
"starbail"formulas, the bailout condition is built around a star.  If 
thestar is centered at the origin and is big enough, then you can
essentiallyuse the star instead of the traditional bailout circle.  This
iswhat has been done in parameter set "starbail1".  The magnification
wasdecreased to show the bailout star, and the fractal can clearly be
seenin the middle.  It is also possible to bailout when the orbit enters
astar.  This is similar to the orbit trap methods that others have
written,and works particularly well for Julia sets that are dusts.  An
exampleof this is in parameter set "starbail2".  Some care must be taken
ifthe star is not centered on the origin.  The "starbail" formulas set
zto a default (1,0) if the orbit was not caught by a star.  If the star
istoo far away or too small to catch many orbits, the majority of the
screenwill be one color (color 0 when using decomposition coloring).  If
youuse stars off of the origin, you may want to increase the size and
set"pixelflag=0" in the formula, to prevent the image from being taken
overby one huge rogue star.

Onefinal note:  This method uses angles a lot to figure out which side
belongsto whom.  Consequently, the ability to rotate the star is a bit
limited.If the rotations are kept to the range of 0 to 36 degrees, there
shouldn'tbe any problems.  Rotations outside this range (try it with the
"star"formula) will result in branch cuts as the formula gets its angles
confused.Fortunately, since the star is symmetric, there shouldn't be
aneed to rotate it beyond those bounds.
