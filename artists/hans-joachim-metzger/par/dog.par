; Fractal image of a dog (?), with .PAR file
;
; Background: I wrote a little program to use Fractint in batch mode to
; generate animations of a fixed region of a fractal, while varying the
; parameters (tracing out a sort of circle in 4-D parameter space).  I
; then make FLC files, which the very nifty and free DISPLAY v1.87 program
; for DOS can both generate and play automatically, from a set of GIFs.
; These animations are kind of interesting in their own right, but at 6
; MB are a bit large to post anywhere :-).
;
; Here a few zooms into an interesting frame of one such FLC, in the
; form of a PAR file.  There is a figure here which looks rather like a
; particular kind of small dog with a squarish muzzle and a little
; goatee, maybe you know the kind I'm thinking of. Although, this one is
; of the unicorn variety and seems to have a bit of dragon blood mixed
; in, so maybe I'm just getting carried away by imagination. Well, I
; think it looks kind of neat anyway.
