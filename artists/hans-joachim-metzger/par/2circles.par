2 Circles Coloring Method

Several coloring schemes have been put together that color according 
to the orbit's nearest approach to a specified point or curve.  This
method extends that idea by coloring according to the orbit's nearest
simultaneous approach to 2 specified circles.

A circle in the x-y plane can be specified by (x - xcenter)^2 +
(y - ycenter)^2 = radius^2, where (xcenter, ycenter) is the coordinate 
of the center of the circle, and radius is the circle's radius.  For
complex numbers z = x+i*y, (and center = xcenter+i*ycenter)

f(z) = |z - center| - radius^2 (using Fractint's || convention)

is a real-valued function that gives the relationship of z to the 
circle.  If f(z) < 0, then z is inside the circle.  A positive
value of f(z) means that z is outside of the circle, and f=0 means 
that z is on the circle.

Using 2 circles then results in 2 functions, fx(z) and fy(z).  One
circle corresponds to fx, and the other to fy.  At each iteration,
a new complex variable, w, can be defined as, w = fx(z)+i*fy(z).
To check for the closest simultaneous approach of the orbit to both
circles, it is sufficient to check for the smallest |w|.  This w is
saved, and at the end of the iteration, "decomp=256" is used to color
the pixel according to the polar angle of w.

In its most general form, this method requires 6 real parameters:  
2 each for the x- and y-coordinates of the centers of the circles,
and 2 for the radii of the 2 circles.  For Mandelbrot implementation,
this requires hardcoding the bailout value, which has been set to 
10^12.  For Julia implementations, the bailout is also hardcoded, but
another 2 parameters are needed to specify the Julia parameter, c.
The "general_jul" formula is written with a hardcoded value of c, to
allow for the greatest flexibility in choosing circles.

A great deal of choice can still be allowed by only using 4 parameters
to choose the circles, thereby freeing the other 2 for picking c.
The "cenx=ceny_jul" method uses concentric circles (both having the 
same center).  The radii of the circles are independently chosen.  
A variation of this is the "cenx=-ceny_jul" formula, wherein the 
centers of the circles are placed symmetrically with respect to the 
origin of the complex plane.  Another variation uses the same radii
for both circles, but different centers.  In "offset_rx=ry_jul", 
this is accomplished by choosing a point on the plane.  One circle 
is place a little outward of this point, and the other is a little
inward of the chosen point.  The amount of shift along the radial
line is 1 of the parameters.

Because of the wide variety of parameter settings, it's not possible
to say what happens with the image as the circles are moved.  However,
you'll get very different results in the circles don't intersect from
when they do.  If they do intersect, you'll tend to see points in the
image where all the colors come together (this corresponds to where
the orbit found the intersection point).  Varied ribbon-like effects
can be seen when the circles are very close to each other--either 
concentric with slightly different radii, or offset by a small amount.
