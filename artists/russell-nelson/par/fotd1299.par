FOTD -- December 16, 1999

Fractal enthusiasts and visionaries:

The formulas used to create fractals nowadays are growing ever 
more complex, while my formulas intentionally remain quite 
simple.  But can a Mandelbrot-style fractal be created by 
iterating a formula such as Z+1/Z -- a formula so simple that it 
can be stated without an exponent?  The not so surprising answer 
is that a fractal not only can be created, but has been created. 
Today's FOTD is the proof.

The mere existence of this particular fractal is so fascinating 
that I return to it again and again.  Indeed, by a slight 
variation of the real(p3) parameter, which controls the initial 
factor of the formula, and by toggling (fn1) between (ident) and 
(recip), an infinity of different fractals can be created by 
nothing more than adding 1/Z to Z.

This afternoon, while gazing at the first Christmas poinsettia, 
I was struck by the resemblance of that flower to today's image. 
I really had little choice other than to name the picture 
"Poinsettia", since I'll always see that flower when I see 
today's picture.  The parameter file is rather slow, making a 
download of the image the better choice.  The image is ready for 
download at the following internet sites:

The local weather experts once again made fools of themselves 
today.  At 10am they were still forecasting sunny skies and a 
temperature of 55F (13C), even three hours after a fog bank had 
rolled in and cut the visibility to less than 100 meters.  At 
midnight it still has not cleared.  The fiasco not only 
embarrassed the experts, it also made the cats unhappy.  The 
temperature of 39F (4C) and wet grass made it unpleasant for 
them to be outdoors.  They satisfied themselves by stuffing 
their stomachs.

I was too busy today to write much philosophy, but tomorrow will 
be here in 24 hours, (it always is), and my philosophy muse, 
(the Muth Muse), could be back on-line by then.  Until that 
moment, take care, and thank goodness the millennium turnover 
happens only once every thousand years.  (It actually happens at 
midnight of December 31 at the end of the year 2000.)

FOTD -- December 17, 1999

Fractal enthusiasts and visionaries:

There's an old Spike Jones song that begins with the following 
words: "As the sun drifts gently from the shore and our ship 
sinks slowly in the west . . ."  This morning, when I turned on 
the local talk radio station, the first thing I heard reminded 
me of those less than classic words.  Coming from my radio I 
heard: "As the old century draws swiftly to a close, and a new 
millennium is about to begin . . ."

The guest then went on to speak his dire warnings of all the 
apocalyptic things that might happen at midnight December 31.  
His warning was naturally followed by panicky callers asking 
what to do.  I don't know about the rest of the world, but I'm 
going to do . . . absolutely nothing, except maybe stock up on a 
day or two of extra food to use if the local market can't get 
its computer to work right.

The media is bombarding us with dire predictions of the 
apocalypse, warning of, among other un-nice things, a worldwide 
breakdown of power and communications.  So dramatic are the 
predictions that one news network will have a reporter stationed 
in each of the world's 30 or so time zones, and present live 
coverage of the arrival of the new year in each zone.  This 
network will then show 100 uninterrupted hours of millennium 
hysteria.  How, I wonder, will this coverage be achieved in the 
middle of a worldwide power and communications breakdown?  And 
why would a network spend so much money on live coverage that it 
has already warned may likely never be seen?

Well, I'll keep fractal fans up to date on the local prepara-
tions.  But my own opinion is that nothing more than an increase 
in computer errors will occur.  Now on to a more fractal topic.

Today's picture is a spectacular one, so spectacular in fact, 
with its writhing beige tendrils and indigo background, that it 
could have been created only by Merlin the Magician.  So that's 
what I named it.  It's part of the fractal that results when the 
formula 0.14(Z^3)-2.11(1/Z)+C is iterated at a critical starting 
value of Z.  (The MandelbrotMix4 formula automatically calcu-
lates a critical point of the formula defined by p1 and p2, and 
applies this value to initial Z.)

The parameter file takes 10 min. on a Pentium200mhz, and 4 min. 
on a top speed PentiumIII.  The download of the finished image 
file is therefore more efficient.  That image file may be found 
on Usenet at:

          <alt.binaries.pictures.fractals>

and on the W.W.W. at:

          <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>

The weather was bright and brisk today, following the much 
belated clearing that finally arrived sometime after midnight.  
The afternoon temperature of 50F (10C) was warm enough for the 
fractal cats to venture outdoors, but not warm enough for them 
to stay out.  They spent most of the afternoon shifting across 
the dining room floor to keep themselves in the ray of sunlight.

The fractosophy didn't make it today.  I have a lot of things in 
mind, but I never found the mood to write them.  As always, I'll 
try again tomorrow.  Until then, take care, and will there be 
life after the "Peanuts" comic strip?

FOTD -- December 18, 1999

Fractal enthusiasts and visionaries:

Nothing is less interesting than a story about a relationship -- 
the manner in which two people, ususally a man and woman, get 
along together.  Really, who would be interested in something as 
trite as whether Jane gets John, or whether Mary will ever stop 
crying because Jim left her.  These things are important when 
they happen to oneself, but they are great sleep producers when 
they are presented happening to others as entertainment.  Yet 
the book racks, TV airwaves, movie theaters and video stores are 
filled with stories about relationships.

But apparently, just because I find it silly to become interes-
ted in how two fictitious characters are interacting, doesn't 
mean everyone finds stories of relationships dull and boring.  
After all, they're not writing relationship stories to go unread 
and unviewed.  And even fractals can have relationships.

Today's picture shows two mandel-midget-like objects so close 
together that they could only be having a relationship.  I 
therefore named the picture "Midget Relationship".  The image 
was quickly produced by number 11 in my series of MandNewt 
formulas, all of which use variations of the Ikenaga function.

Today's FOTD is also a product of Fractint's evolver.  Lacking 
the time for a proper fractal search, I fed the formula into the 
evolver and let the parameters vary at random.  Then, when the 
screen was filled with thumbnails, I chose the most interesting 
looking sketch and rendered it full size, which for the FOTD is 
640x480.

The result is a rather blocky but still interesting picture 
showing two objects that look like but are not Mandeloid 
midgets.  The buds of these objects are surrounded by clouds of 
smaller midgets, both single and double.

A close look at today's image will reveal that it is split 
neatly down the center, the split passing precisely between the 
two midgets.  And many of the smaller midgets in the surrounding 
clouds are also split in exactly the same way.

The parameter file renders in less than 3 minutes, relatively 
quickly but still slow enough to make a download of the finished 
image more efficient.

That image may be found at:

          <alt.binaries.pictures.fractals>

and at:

          <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>

The fractal weather today was a somewhat above normal 50F (10C), 
a bit too chilly for cats who are designed for the heat of 
northern Africa, but perfect for fractals.

I've just passed my peak.  The hour is growing late and the 
fractal cats are calling for their midnight snacks.  Until next 
time, which will be tomorrow, take care, and remember that a bit 
of belief is good for your health.

FOTD -- December 19, 1999

Fractal enthusiasts and visionaries:

Today we have a fractal that looks as though it had been scraped 
from the bottom of Chesapeake Bay -- a fractal so filled with 
holes that its pattern is almost totally obscured in a chaos of 
sand.  I named the grainy scene "Sandy Bottom" because it 
resembles the sandy bottom of our local estuary.

It is quite a slow image when calculated from the parameter 
file, so the JPEG'd image has been posted as usual to:

          <alt.binaries.pictures.fractals>

as well as to:

          <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>

But the JPEG version that I just retrieved from ABPF has lost 
much of its sparkle.  I'm therefore going to cancel the JPEG 
version and post the GIF version in its place.  If you find a 
stray copy of the JPEG version, do not download it.  Download 
only the GIF version.

The formula behind the image is once again the MandelbrotMix4, 
this time calculating 0.0002(Z^6)+6(1/Z)+C, and doing a rather 
fair job of it at that.

The fractal weather today was every bit as nondescript as it has 
been over the past several days, the partly cloudy sky and 
temperature of 50F (10C) being perfect for cats, fractals and 
philosophizing.  Taking advantage of the perfection, the cats 
chased the sun, I chased fractals, and then I philosophized.

But my philosophy, which once again concerns skepticism, 
fractals and reality, has not yet ripened.  It may be ripe by 
tomorrow, or it may be over-ripe by tomorrow . . . or it may 
still be unripe by tomorrow.  Check then for possible enlighten-
ment, but more likely for a display of confusion.  Until then, 
take care, and may you have a peaceful next 14 days.

FOTD -- December 20, 1999

Fractal enthusiasts and visionaries:

Today's fractal is a real quickie.  Being busy with seasonal 
chores on this last Sunday before the holidays, I had little 
time for a proper fractal search.  In a bit of desperation, I 
brought up my MandelbrotMiN formula, which calculates Mandeloids 
of the type (-Z)^n+C.  For today's image I set p1 so that the 
(-Z)^1.618+C Mandeloid was calculated.  I always calculate (-Z) 
instead of Z when the exponent is less than 2.  (-Z) creates far 
more interesting images.

When the exponent of Z is set to a value less than 2, the 
midgets become very difficult to find, though in today's case we 
have an exception.  The midget in the picture is located near 
the shoreline of a larger midget, which in turn is located 
rather conspicuously in the chaos near the eastern shore of the 
parent fractal.  I named the picture "Wrap-Around Midget" 
because the midget seems to be wrapping around some unseen point.

In fact, the curiously distorted midget doesn't seem to be quite 
all there.  It almost looks as though some of it has folded 
under itself and slipped into some vague imaginary dimension 
known only to fractals.  The extremely chaotic appearance of the 
surrounding fractal material is typical of the midgets found in 
fractals in this exponent range.  Yet even through the chaos, 
the familiar fractal filaments are there.  And still smaller 
midgets are waiting on several filaments to be discovered and 
turned into the next FOTD.  I hate to disappoint these tiny 
midgets, but they all look the same as the large midget in the 
picture today -- not worth the hour or so it would take to 
render them.

As a rule, the midgets in Mandeloids of order n have n-1 lobes.  
Since today's Mandeloid is of order 1.618, the midgets in it 
have 0.618 lobes.  What part of the single lobe is the remaining 
0.382 subtracted from?, one might wonder.  My explorations to 
this point have led me to believe that the 0.382 lobe can be 
taken from almost any part of the Z^2 shape.  There is no 
standard shape for midgets in this exponent range, and this is 
one of the things that makes exploring between Z and Z^2 
interesting.

Today's parameter file requires 1/2 hour to complete.  The JPEG 
image file downloads from:

          <alt.binaries.pictures.fractals>

or from:

          <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>

in far less time.

The fractal weather today was more of the same thing -- partly 
cloudy with a temperature of 44F (7C), which was perfect for 
both cats and fractals.  It was also good for philosophy, though 
I got most of that out of me earlier this evening.  Maybe I'll 
call a halt to new philosophy until after the holidays, and give 
everyone a chance to have a peaceful new millennium.

But the fractals will continue, and the next one is less than 24 
hours away.  Until then, take care, and I wonder how many 
fractals Santa could pack in that bag of his.

FOTD -- December 21, 1999

Fractal enthusiasts and visionaries:

Every now and then I find a fractal that defies description, a 
fractal so outrageously bizarre that it even defies naming.  
Today's fractal is one of these indescribable images.

The picture was created by number four of my series of 12 
formulas, which I named MandNewt before I realized they were 
variations of the Ikenaga function.  I named the picture 
"Mandelbay Madhouse" when, after thinking for 15 minutes, I 
could find no better name.

Actually, the name isn't that far off the mark.  It's hard to 
find a central theme for this gloriously abstract image, filled 
as it is with clusters of bof60 bubbles and remnants of Mandel-
buds, and colored according to no rules that I am familiar with. 
After scanning the image for several minutes, my eye finally 
settled on the prominent almost-perfect Mandel-bay somewhat left 
of center, which became the inspiration for the name.

The parameter file is slow; a download is fast.  I recommend the 
download.  The JPEG image can be found on Usenet at:

          <alt.binaries.pictures.fractals>

and on the Web at Paul's site at:

          <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>

The fractal weather today was cloudy and chilly, with occasional 
rain and a temperature of 45F (7C) making things extra 
miserable.  Unable to go outdoors, the fractal cats grew sulky 
and eventually got into a squabble.  A serving of their favorite 
food treat restored their good humor.

Due to a relative slack in the work, it was also a good day for 
philosophizing.  Never one to let an opportunity slip by, I

Until tomorrow, when I'll return with another fractal and a few

peace on earth when peace is the universal wish of mankind?

FOTD -- December 21, 1999

Fractal enthusiasts and visionaries:

Every now and then I find a fractal that defies description, a 
fractal so outrageously bizarre that it even defies naming.  
Today's fractal is one of these indescribable images.

The picture was created by number four of my series of 12 
formulas, which I named MandNewt before I realized they were 
variations of the Ikenaga function.  I named the picture 
"Mandelbay Madhouse" when, after thinking for 15 minutes, I 
could find no better name.

Actually, the name isn't that far off the mark.  It's hard to 
find a central theme for this gloriously abstract image, filled 
as it is with clusters of bof60 bubbles and remnants of Mandel-
buds, and colored according to no rules that I am familiar with. 
After scanning the image for several minutes, my eye finally 
settled on the prominent almost-perfect Mandel-bay somewhat left 
of center, which became the inspiration for the name.

The parameter file is slow; a download is fast.  I recommend the 
download.  The JPEG image can be found on Usenet at:

          <alt.binaries.pictures.fractals>

and on the Web at Paul's site at:

          <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>

The fractal weather today was cloudy and chilly, with occasional 
rain and a temperature of 45F (7C) making things extra 
miserable.  Unable to go outdoors, the fractal cats grew sulky 
and eventually got into a squabble.  A serving of their favorite 
food treat restored their good humor.

Due to a relative slack in the work, it was also a good day for 
philosophizing.  Never one to let an opportunity slip by, I 
philosophized.  I found some interesting new angles on some 
controversial old problems, but I've decided to withhold comment 
until after Y2K, when we're more knowledgeable about what will 
happen when the clock makes the big turnover.  Also, it's the 
time of year when peace on earth is the goal.  We might not have 
actual peace on earth, but we'll have it on the philofractal 
list -- at least until the next millennium.

Until tomorrow, when I'll return with another fractal and a few 
words about the fractal, take care, and why is there so little 
peace on earth when peace is the universal wish of mankind?

FOTD -- December 22, 1999

Fractal enthusiasts and visionaries:

Today's fractal is a somber one, filled with darkness and 
relieved only by sharply defined shafts of deep violet, almost 
an ultra-violet.  It could be a stylized exploding galaxy, or it 
could be a design in a stained-glass window of some grotesque 
cathedral.  It could be these and much more, but it is a fractal.

It is today's fractal -- a scene cut in the Rectangular 
direction through the four-dimensional figure defined by the 
formula 3.5*((-z)^1.1+z^1.1)+c.  The Rectangular direction is my 
own name for the orientation determined by the imag(z) and 
imag(c) axes.

It is probably the darkest in overall value as well as in mood 
of all my FOTD's, quite in keeping with the season of Advent 
which is rapidly coming to a close as the big day approaches.  I 
named the picture "A Fractal Secret" because I'm not sure what 
it reminds me of, and I didn't want to call it "I Don't Know".

The formula behind the image is my RectPMnew -- a formula that I 
rarely pull out -- not because it is worthless, but rather 
because I have so many other formulas to investigate and not all 
that much time to do the investigation.

In contrast to some of my recent FOTD's, today's parameter file 
takes less than 6 seconds to run on a Pentium 200mhz, that is 
after the minute or two it will take to copy this message to 
your Fractint parameter directory and run it from there.

For those who would rather download the finished JPEG image, 
that image is available on the Usenet binary newsgroup:

          <alt.binaries.pictures.fractals>

The image is also available on the web at Paul Lee's FOTD web 
site at the following URL:

          <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>

The weather began turning winterish today here at Fractal 
Central -- cloudy, cold, bleak and raw, with a few periods of 
sleet and a promise of perhaps a little light snow overnight.  
The temperature of 38F (3C) was far too chilly for the fractal 
cats to venture outdoors, so they spent the day alternately 
chasing each other and stretched out by a radiator.

Chilly days are also great for philosophizing, and I had a 
pretty good day with the philosophy, though I'll hold it until 
after the holidays, when the world will be in an entirely new 
era.

Until tomorrow, same time same place, take care, and never give 
up on a fractal unless it gives up on you.

FOTD -- December 23, 1999

Fractal enthusiasts and visionaries:

Today's midget, which was created by the MandelbrotMix4 formula 
calculating Z-3Z^(-3)+C reminds me of a time warp.  Time warps, 
of course, are the things fiction writers tell of.  They do not 
exist . . . or do they.  A time warp could perhaps best be 
defined as a discontinuity in the time dimension.  But if this 
definition is accepted, time warps become an every day reality.

Last Saturday evening I experienced a time warp.  When I 
finished my FOTD, I ensconced myself in my favorite chair to 
watch one of those junky old sci-fi thriller movies that they 
don't make any longer.  (For good reason)  I inserted the tape 
into the VCR and saw the movie begin.  Then, there was a sudden 
time warp and the movie was ending.  I thought the VCR might 
have malfunctioned until I checked the clock and saw that the 
time actually was 75 minutes later than it had been only 5 
minutes previously.  The time stream had instantly jumped more 
than one hour into the future.

But the time stream had not jumped; I had fallen asleep and for 
75 minutes been unaware of the passage of time.  I then began 
thinking of my experience.  It could be seen in two different 
ways.  Had I been unconscious for 75 minutes, or had time 
instantly jumped 75 minutes into the future?  From my individual 
point of view, there was no way of knowing, since both events 
would have seemed exactly the same to me.  Common sense tells me 
to explain the time discontinuity by claiming that I had fallen 
asleep and been unaware of time for 75 minutes.  But I wonder if 
this is just another way of saying that my private time-stream 
experienced a discontinuous leap of 75 minutes into the future.

I thought of that event today when I was studying today's 
picture, which I named "Timewarped Midget".  The image is one of 
a midget sitting back in time, which exists along the Z axis of 
the image.  I'd estimate the midget to be around 30 minutes in 
the past of the areas around the edge of the image.  I have 
given the scene a dark blue color palette to emphasize the 
mystery of time.

And speaking of time, it becomes relatively unimportant when the 
parameter file is run.  Even the slowest Pentium will finish the 
image in less than 2 minutes.  As always, the JPEG file has been 
posted to:

          <alt.binaries.pictures.fractals>

and to:

          <http://home.att.net/~Paul.N.Lee/FotD/FotD.html>

The fractal weather was rather winterish today.  Just a trace of 
snow fell during the overnight, and that little bit melted by 
the late morning when the sun broke through.  But the tempera-
ture of 41F (5C) was too cold for the delicate fractal cats, who 
passed the afternoon watching the birds at the feeder.

Though conditions were good, I exhausted today's philosophical 
energies thinking about the nature of time.  But tomorrow is a 
new day, and a new opportunity for new philosophy.

Until tomorrow at this same time, take care, and time waits for 
no one.
