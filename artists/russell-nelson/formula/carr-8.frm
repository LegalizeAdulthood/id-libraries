{
Some years back while serving a "dime" at Joliet for embezalment, I
chanced on a fellow inmate who was serving 2 "dimes". Let's call this
fellow inmate Al Cappone to secure his anonimity. Big Al supplied me
with some combinations to some of the largest bank vaults in the
world. He was about to give me the names of the banks that the
combinations fit when he took a shive between the ribs. Al died
instantly.

For years now I've been trying to match the combinations to different
banks. NO LUCK!! I've written these numbers in this file and perhaps
someone out there can make better use of them than Al and myself did.
I won't be having much use for them cause I've been framed on a bum
rap and I'm headed back to Joliet to serve another "dime". By the
time I get out I'll be 108 years old. The old nimble fingers won't
work well at that age so I'm planning a less stressful career.
