I think Newton's Secant method of solving non-linear equations is a very useful
method for creating Fractal Patterns, and I would like to share this with you,
my Fractint friends.

The basic iterative equation to solve f{z(n)} = 0 is:
z(n+1) = z(n) - f{z(n)}/f'{z(n)}, and I'm sure you know that f' is the
derivative  - the slope of the curve f{z(n)} at z(n).

I understand this by visualising a set of axes - f{z(n)} is the `y' axis, and
z the `x' axis. I think of the curve  starting in the bottom left quadrant,
moving to the bottom right, and then zooming up into the top right quadrant.
The solution f{z(n)} = 0 is the value of z where the curve crosses the z axis.
Put z(0), the first guess at the solution to the right of the crossing point.
Draw a line vertically upwards from z(0) to meet the curve f{z(n)} at f{z(0)},
and draw the tangent there.   Slide down the tangent until you hit the z axis
at z(1), and you've completed the first iteration, which is hopefully closer to
the solution than your first guess.  Now go up from z(1), hit the curve and
slide down the tangent f'{z(1)}to the z axis at z(2), which should be still
nearer the solution.  Repeat until f{z(n)} is as close to zero as desired, i.e.
until f{z(n)} <= Tolerance, say 0.0001, and our equation is solved.  And
already we have one thing we can change to change the picture - the Tolerance-
the greater the tolerance the more iterations.

The next thing we can do is to change the slope - say by adding P1, so the
slope is f'{z(n)}+ P1, and this will change the number f iterations to achieve
a solution.  The equation is now:  z(n+1) = z(n) - f{z(n)}/[f'{z(n)}+ P1].

The third thing we can do it to compute  the derivative f'{z(n)}, and one way
of doing this is to use f'{z(n)}= [f{z(n + h)} - f{z(n)}]/h, where he is
usually quite small like 0.0001.  So we create the slope from its secant - and
this is called Newton's Secant Method.  By changing the value of h we can
change the  picture - now we have three ways of changing the picture - vary P1,
h or the tolerance.

The slope can also be calculated using:  f'{z(n)}= [f{z(n)} - f{z(n - h)}]/h.
Both these methods suffer an error of he order of h times the second derivative
f''{z(n)}, which can be quite large - but it doesn't really matter for creating
pictures.

If we add the two equations and divide by two we get
f'{z(n)}= [f{z(n + h)} - f{z(n - h)}]/2h, which is much more accurate having an
error of the order of h squared .times the third derivative f'''{z(n)} - and of
course if you're dealing with a cubic, this is zero!!!  But of course varying h
using this method doesn't change the slope and therefore the picture much - so
it's just quite interesting!!!  The formulae in davweird.frm for the cubic
fz = (z-1)*(z - c + 0.5)*(z + c + 0.5), having the slope
fdashz = 3*z*z - c*c - 0.75, using the analytical and the secant methods are:

ANALYTICAL:}

newdavidsmask(XAXIS) = {
c = pixel,
z = pixel:
fz = (z-1)*(z - c + 0.5)*(z + c + 0.5);
fdashz = 3*z*z - c*c - 0.75;
z = z - fz/(fdashz - P1);
0.000001 <= |fz|
}
comment={newdavidsmasksec is computed using the Newton's secant version of
newdavidsmask; the derivative is computed from the fundamental definition
{f(z+h)-f(z)}/h.


SECANT:}

newdavidsmasksec(XAXIS) = {
h =  0.00001,
c = pixel,
z = pixel:
zplh = z + h;
fz = (z-1)*(z - c + 0.5)*(z + c + 0.5);
fzplh = (zplh-1)*(zplh - c + 0.5)*(zplh + c + 0.5);
fdashz = (fzplh - fz)/h;
z = z - fz/(fdashz - P1);
0.000001 <= |fz|

This cubic is an extremely rich source of pictures including some in
davweird.par, which have also been published in:

The astonishingly accurate Richardson's method for f'(z) is used in:

Your homework is to make the Winged Temple look like it `should' as published
in (1).  I don't have the original here in Hong Kong - and using my saved .PAR
file gets a different picture.  If you use any of these ideas or pictures in
davweird.* I WOULD like some credit or boodle - ENJOY! -
