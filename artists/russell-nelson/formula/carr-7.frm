{
Some years back when I was a Deputy Marshall (under Marshall Wyatt Earp)
in Tombstone Arizona, I occasioned upon an old Indian gentleman. Lore
had it that this elder statesman was "way ahead of his time". 

During a conversation I found that the guy was an Iraquois Indian
from the NorthEast. Years back he had walked to the west in search
of a fabeled Wampum mine. To give you an example of how far ahead
this fellow was, when I called him an Indian he said "me no Indian,
me Native American". Needless to say, this term didn't become general 
usage till some hundred years later.

Apparently this "Native American" was the guy that developed the 
formula for the stress factors in a Teepee. Along with this formula
he had many, many more of greater complexity. After a few rounds of
"fire water" he became loose tongued and wrote down all of his 
formulas. He then had me memorize the instructions for the use 
of these written complexities. After many hours, the memorazation was
complete. At that point he passed out cold.

I headed back to town as I knew Marshal Earp would be returning
from Dodge. As luck would have it, just outside of Tombstone, I was
bushwacked by a desporado. I killed the maggot but in the process
my skull was creased from a shot from his Colt 44. 

The folowing day I got out the formulas to go over them. Damn!!!
The skull shot caused amnesia and I was unable to make heads or
tails of them. I immediatly went to the new Doc in town 
(Dr. Sig Freud) who was supposed to be good at problems like mine.

To make a long story short, I never got my memory back. Now in my
twilight years, I'm releasing these hither-to-unknown formulas
to the computer public to see if they will be of some use to 
someone.
