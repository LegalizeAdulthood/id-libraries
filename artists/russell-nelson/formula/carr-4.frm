{
Some years back, while I was being held prisoner on Devil's Island
for being a Bonapartist, I came upon an Abbey Priest. He too was a 
prisoner. Our chance meeting came about while each of us were 
trying to tunnel out of this hell hole prison. During our mandatory
hourly breaks the Abbey would instruct me in a new form of 
mathmatics, by candle light. At the conclusion of the course he
gave me a sheet of paper that he had hidden in the crusafix that
he wore around his neck. "These formulas" he said "will some day
bring you untold riches." Upon handing me the paper he croaked.

To this day I have not been able to unscramble the formulas. I now 
list them below with the hope that someone out there will be able
to make some sense and use of them.
