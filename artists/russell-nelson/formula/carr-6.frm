{
Some years ago, when I was a lead Astronaut for N.A.S.A., myself and 
John Clenn were sent on a secret mission to explore Mickey (a 
here-to-for unknown planet adjacent to Pluto). When John (later to
become Senator John Clenn) and I eventually reached Mickey after
a 12 year flight (one way), we occasioned upon a civilization much
more advanced then we expected (but just as advanced as the C.I.A.
suspected). To go into the details of what we found would probably
bore you so I won't go into them here, suffice it to say that they
had computers some 12 to the 104 power years ahead of us.

As luck would have it, we found a very friendly alien who was 
to explain his computer programing to us. In fact, he even wrote
the information on 2 pieces of Thronk (Mickey's version of paper).
The first piece of Thronk contained all the formulas and the second
piece of Thronk contained the instructions on how to use them. 
After a stay of 3 years on Mickey we got orders to return home to
Earth. So we packed our gear and left.

During our 12 year return voyage John and I had a few free moments
so we started to go over the formulas. There was a little 
something that I didn't understand so I looked for the instruction
sheet. I couldn't find it. I asked John if he knew where it was
and he said he thought I packed it. Damn!! We left the instruction
sheet back at Mickey.

To make a long story short, to this day we haven't been able to 
crack the formulas so they are released here in the hope that an
Earthling might be of some help.

These formulas are not to be used for ANY commercial venture
