			INFORMATION RE ORGFRM.ZIP



0RGFRM.ZIP includes the following:

	ORGFORM.DOC - this document
	
	ORGFORM.EXE - a program to build and maintain an organized Fractint 
		      formula directory
	
	_*.FRM      - various files containing Fractint formulas, created
		      from the files on my hard drive as of 9/12/95. These 
		      include virtually all formulas uploaded to the
		      Graphics Developers Forum of CompuServe through that
		      date. There are more that 2200 formulas in these files.

	Fractint is a freeware fractal generating program ((C) The Stone Soup 
Group) available from Library 4 of the Graphics Developers Forum of 
CompuServe as FRAINT.EXE. If you are not familiar with Fractint, you should 
download the program and prepare to have your life become a shambles. ORGFORM
is a utility to deal with certain DOS text files used by Fractint. These 
files have an extension ".frm" and contain formulas which Fractint can use to
generate fractal images. For an excellent description of how these formulas
are structured and how peoople with a creative turn of mind can compose 
original formulas, see Bradley Beacham's tutorial, available in the same 
forum Library as Fractint under the name FRMTUT.ZIP.

	Those who create formulas are not lacking in energy. Some users have
created hundreds of formulas, and more are posted to the CompuServe forum
regularly. These postings are essentially unregulated, which is only proper,
but as a result the accumulated postings contain many copies because formulas
are reposted for various reasons. In addition, and more worrisome, is the
fact that there is no standardized naming conventions for formulas, and 
there are many cases where a formula name has been used again for a 
completely different formula.

	My goal has been twofold: first, develop a set a formula files 
containing unique formula entries only; and, second, organize the files so 
that different formulas with the same name are readily identifiable. 
The result is ORGFORM (ORGanize FORMulas).


=================
ORGFORM.EXE v. 1
=================

	ORGFORM is (c) George G. Martin, 1995. The program is freeware.
The program may be distributed for private use without notice to the
author. However, no commercial use of the program may be made unless the 
author's consent has been obtained. My CompuServe number is 76440,1143.
Please let me know if you have any comments or suggestions. Although no
registration is required, if you let me know by E-Mail that you are a user
of the program and give me a return E-Mail address, I will let you know
when (and if) later versions of the program are posted.

	No representation or warranty of any kind is made with respect to
this program. 

	INPUT: Command line syntax is ORGFORM [path\inputfiles... ]

	Any number of arguments can be used, and standard DOS filename 
wildcards are permitted.

	EXAMPLE: orgform  *.frm  c:\temp\a*.frm
    
	will take all formula files in the current directory and all formula 
files beginning with "a" in the temp directory as input. HOWEVER: no matter 
what arguments are used, the program will not open any input file  
which does not have an extension ".frm", and also any file whose name 
begins with an underscore (e.g. a.doc and _a.frm would not be opened, even 
if the command line argument were *.*).

	Input files are opened only for purposes of reading them; they are
not changed by ORGFORM.

	OUTPUT: The program reads each formula entry from the input files, and
copies it to a file with the name _?.frm, depending on the first letter of 
the formula (e.g. a formula named George would be copied to _g.frm); if the
output file does not exist, it will be created. Formulas beginning with 
numbers are added to _num.frm, and with non-alpha characters to _chr.frm.
If the file exists, the formula will be added to the file; existing 
entries will not be affected. If a formula with the same name is present in 
the output file, the program checks to see if the symmetry and formula math 
are the same - if they are, the formula is not added to the file, thus 
avoiding the accumulation of identical entries. If the symmetry or math is 
not the same, the formula is added to a file with the name _?_dup.frm 
(e.g. if a formula George was found but had different math, the new George 
would be added to _g_dup.frm). When a formula is added to a file, a comment 
is inserted in the formula entry showing the name of the source file. 

	The comments and text in an input file appearing between formula 
entries are ignored by the program - only the formula entries themselves 
(including the comments contained within the entries) are written to the 
output file.

	All output files are written to the current directory. 

	After the processing of the formulas is completed, the program
rewrites each output file to put the formula entries into alphabetical order.
In effect, the output files are a multi-volume encyclopedia of the formulas 
which you have. When others upload formulas, you can run them through 
ORGFORM, and only those entries which you don't have will be extracted and 
added to the output files.

=================================         
FORMULAS INCLUDED IN THIS PACKAGE
=================================

	I ran ORGFORM on my formulas directory, and the resulting output
files are included in orgfrm.zip. The directory has about 130 formula 
files containing about 7000 formulas. Certain files are compilations of
other files (often easily identified by their size, which tend to be much
larger than original source files); I renamed these with extension ".~rm" 
and ran ORGFORM first on the original source files, in order to get these
formulas into the output files first. I then renamed the compilations back
to ".frm" and reran ORGFORM, picking up any formulas in them which had not
already be extracted in the first run. The resulting output files contain
about 2300 entries - more than 2/3 of my formulas directory consisted of
copies of other existing formulas!

	The directory listing of my formulas directory is at the end of
this document. Virtually all of these files were obtained from Library 4
of the Graphics Developers Forum of CompuServe.

COMMENTS ON "SAME NAME" FORMULAS
================================

Here is a summary of the *_dup.frm files included in orgfrm.zip. These are
comments about formulas which have the same name as other formulas. The 
subheadings are formula names; the explanatory text uses the names of the 
source files, but without the .frm extension.

    form1 and tchebych. The formulas are the same. tchebych is an
    error - it has a line break in the middle of an expression. form1
    doesn't work either, but is too large to edit with the DOS edit
    command.

     identical set of formulas in fractint and jmcr2. The latter
     declares xaxis symmetry for each of them. In addition, improved has
     a different version of Jm_27. (jmcr2 also has many additional
     formulas in this series).

julia, lambdafnorfn, mandel
     builtn2 makes changes to builtn.

lambdafn
     builtn2 makes a change to builtn (adds a leading zero to a
     floating point number).


magnet1m, magnet2m
     different formulas in ebbert and builtn. The ebbert formula
     also declares xaxis symmetry.

Mandelbrot(XAXIS)
     improved generalizes fractint. Each of these use a"Lastsqr"
     feature to speed the calculation. frmtutor writes the classic
     mandelbrot formula in the traditional way.

ManInTheOzoneC(XAXIS_NOPARM)
     choice and form1 use different functions (cos v. cosxx)

     fract002 generalizes drcha. Also drcha shows origin symmetry.

Moth(XAXIS_NOPARM)
     select and choice are different

Mothra (XAXIS)
     fractint and form1 contain different formulas. The appear to
     be the same math, but the presentation is quite different.

Natura, Raphaelbrot
     fract002 generalizes drcha. Also, drcha declares xyaxis
     symmetry.

001, 003, 004, 005, 006, 007, 008, 009, 010, 011, 012
     new_d generalizes damion. For 001, 003, and 005, both sets
     declare yzxis symmetry. kgnew has a different formula in each case.

 002
     new_d generalizes damion and damion2. All 3 declare yzxis
     symmetry. kgnew has a different formula.

013, 014, 015, 016, 017
     new_d generalizes damion2. 014 declares pi_sym, 014 xaxis
     symmetry, and 017 xyaxis symmetry in both of these. kgnew has a
     different formula in each case.

018, 019 (PI_SYM), 020 (XYAXIS), 021, 022, 023, 024, 025, 026,
027(XYAXIS)

08-Carr, 09-Carr, 11-Carr, 12-Carr, 13-Carr, 14-Carr
     carr and 01carr contain different formulas. NOTE - in my
     Carr.frm, 12-carr was missing the closing brace.

Phoenix
     phoeni and reb006 have different versions.

REB004N
     NOTA BENE - formulas.frm contains about 44 entries crammed
     onto one line of text beginning with this formula. A text editor is
     needed to break the lines appropriately. When I did this, all the
     formulas which emerged out of the rubble were already included from
     other files

Sam_8
     fract003 is described as a fix of sam, and it appears to be
     so.

SGG005
     Formula is in guenzel and 941227. The difference is in the
     bailout test, which in guenzel is stated as an absolute value.

SinEgg(XAXIS_NOPARM), SinEggC(XAXIS_NOPARM)
     fract003 generalizes choice.

SinhEgg(XAXIS_NOPARM)
     select generalizes choice.
