Here are some fractals that I created while playing with Fractint.
They are some of my first tries at creating fractals, so any comments
(positive or negative) would be helpful.

Fractal1{
	z=0,c=pixel:
	z=sin(Z/.4)+c
	|z|<4
}

Fractal2{
	z=0,c=pixel:
	z=z^500+c
	|z|<4
}

Fractal3{
	z=0,c=pixel:
	z=cotan(z*z)+c
	|z|<4
}
