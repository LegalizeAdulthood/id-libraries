To get this view you need 80 bit floats such as that provided by INTEL.
I rolled my own code in C++ (also you can use Turbo Pascal) using
long double.  If you are stuck with double, you only get 54 bits mantissa
or 10^-16 resolution.  Robert P Munafo <mrob@WORLD.STD.COM> did mention
this is his original post.  Unfortunately, this leaves you about 10^4
short of zomming into his 'view'.  No matter how many digits we have there
is always still a deeper zoom  ;-)  
 
For those on sci.fractals, to which I'm cross posting this, Robert did
provide an interesting view to try with normal double-precision:
 
   -1.749 925 438  +  0.000 000 000 i, size 2.98e-7 and
   -1.749 925 361 593 013 94  +  0.000 000 004 193 282 92 i, size 1.11e-15
 
These are near the tree strucrutes I mentioned in 
<1993Oct14.170930.2402@ast.saic.com>.  The tree structures I noted are
the 'large scale' filements along which are very small island msets.  It
is near one of these into which Robert suggests zooming.
