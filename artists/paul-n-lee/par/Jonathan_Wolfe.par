Ok, if you've never really explored the x->x^3 fractals, I have the .par
file to whet your appetite! All of the same basic principles in the
Mandelbrot set and Julia sets seem to carry over from the x^2 case,
except that instead of bifurcating, everything trifurcates. So instead
of seeing eightfold symmetries, you see 9 fold... And where you'd expect
double spirals, you find triple ones. The .par file I'm including shows  
a triangular triple-triple spiral construction. For non-fractint folks,  
you can see this fractal by plugging the first two params listed  
as the C value into a julia set of x->x^3+C.  
        I found this one by going into the elephant valley of the  
x^3 M-set, zooming one of the major spirals, then zooming one of the
triple spirals, then doing it again, then taking a julia set from the
inside edge of a mini-Mset. It's easy enough to retrace, if you really  
want to see the details. Note that the little 3-fold black thing in the
center is of course, NOT a mini-Mandel, but a mini-Julia taken from a
mini-Mandel.
        Here's what I want to know, and I invite answers from anyone who
can contribute to an understanding of the M-J relationship:
        I think I can understand why a Julia set of the form x->x^n+C
has n-fold symmetry. But why does the associated M-set have (n-1) fold
symmetry??? Why!????                                        -----    
        Somebody please try to explain (and not in German, preferably!)

Incidentally, after spending weeks in the Depths, this calculation seems
to fly by in only about 10 minutes...


Enjoy!
        Jonathan
