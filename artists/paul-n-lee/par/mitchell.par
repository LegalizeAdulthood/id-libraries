Near to a given line

This method (also called, "nearline") is an extension of Fractint's
bof60 scheme.  In bof60, the question is asked, "how close does the
orbit come to the origin?", or, "what is the minimum magnitude of the
iterate?"  In nearline, we are curious about approach to a given line,
instead of the origin [the origin is the point 0+0i in the complex
plane, also written (0,0)].  The lines in question are all straight and
pass through the origin, so they have the equation, y=kx.  The slope of
the line, k, is equal tan(theta), where theta is the angle of the line
with respect to the x-axis.  Given that tan = sin/cos, an alternative
way to write the equation of the line is to define a distance quantity,
r, and set r equal to 0:

r = cos(theta) * y - sin(theta) * x = 0.

So the basis of this coloring method is, for a given theta, what is the
minimum value of |r|?

Given a minimum value of |r| for the orbit, the formulas plot the results
by taking the log of |r|, and using that as the polar angle of z for the
decomposition coloring.  This has the advantage of being able to handle a
wide range of values without rescaling, and compressing them into a small
variable space.  Decomposition wraps automatically, so no clipping is
encountered if the color overruns the 0 - 255 index range.  And, the log
function is only executed once per orbit, so the time penalty is minimal.

The general nature of this coloring is a series of lines, starting at the
fractal boundary and heading to infinity, asymptotic to the angle theta.
How these lines interact and intersect varies greatly with the choice of
theta.  Specifically, it is not clear what values of theta to choose to
cause the lines to intersect at the origin.  However, the lines can be
chosen in terms of iterations instead of angle.  The first iterate of (0,0)
is simply c, so, from the above equation, we can force the lines to cross
at the origin after 1 iteration by making

r = imag(c) * x - real(c) * y,

and clearly, r will be 0 at the origin at the first iteration.
Similarly, if we define

zero2 = c*c + c
      = the second iterate of (0,0), and

zero3 = zero2*zero2 + c
      = the third iterate of (0,0), then

r = imag(zero2) * x - real(zero2) * y

will cause an intersection at the second iteration, and

r = imag(zero3) * x - real(zero3) * y

will cause an intersection at the third iteration.  These techniques
are employed in nearline01_jul, -02_jul, and -03_jul, respectively.
Such actions are not required for the Mandelbrot variation, since the
origin is a fixed point, and all its iterates are zero.

While initially an external coloring scheme, this method works for
the inside as well.  Fundamentally, there's no difference between the
fractal interior and exterior with this method, so the formulas force
all iterations to escape, allowing interior points to be rendered via
decomposition, instead of relying on "inside=zmag".

The Bubble Method

The bubble method is an extension of Fractint's bof60 scheme.  In
bof60, the interior of the fractal is colored by how closed the iterate
comes to the origin.  In the bubble method, a specific value is set as
the threshold.  Each step, the magnitude of the iterate is compared to
the threshold.  If the current magnitude is smaller, it becomes the new
threshold level.  The effect is to cover the fractal with "bubbles",
circles the radius of the threshold.  Below a certain threshold value,
the image is a dust of small, disconnected bubbles.  At a particular
theshold value, which varies with the parameter c, the circles all
touch.  Beyond this, the circles squish into each other, like mounds
of soap bubbles.

At bailout, if the image is colored by the last threshold, each bubble
will be filled with rings of concentric circles, representing the range
of minima from the original threshold level down to zero.

Alternatively, the bubbles can be colored by the polar angle of the
iterate, as in the standard Fractint decomposition method.  Here, the
disks become filled with radial lines of color, emminating from the
center of the disk.

The formulas "bubbleboth" (Mandelbrot and Julia variations) combine
the concentric circle and ray colorings.  The magnitude of the final
minimum is scaled into an angle.  This is averaged with the polar angle
of the final iterate, using user-supplied weights.  This allows the
specification of either circles or rays using the same formula.  In
between (for example, using equal amounts of circle and ray) are swirls.
A judicious choice of color map will eliminate the branch cuts that can
be seen with the swirls.

Ghost

In the ghost coloring scheme, you can make the fractal appear or disappear 
against a gradient background.  It is based on the iteration smoothing 
routine of Linas Vepstas, and uses an adjustable parameter to determine 
how prevalent the fractal appears.

The iteration smoothing technique works by letting the iterate go much 
beyond the required escape radius of 4, and converting its geometric 
growth into a real number.  When combined with the original iteration 
number, the result is a real number that can be plotted continuously 
with the decomposition (or outside=real) methods.  Here, the smoothed 
iteration count is scaled and made the polar angle for the decomposition 
coloring.

The backgrounds for these images are gradients (using smooth color maps), 
running horizontally, vertically, or in rays from the origin (point 0+0i).  
In the latter case, the background is simply the polar angle of the pixel, 
which may or may not be centered on the screen, depending on the zoom of 
the image.  In the former two cases, the gradients are dynamically set to 
use the full color range irrespective of the pixel coordinates.  In any 
case, the background is represented by an angle, for use with decomposition.

Given angles for both the iteration count and the background image, they 
are combined using the "ghost" parameter.  The iteration angle is scaled 
by "ghost" and added to the background angle.  When the ghost level is 
set to zero, then only the background angle remains, and that is what is 
shown in the image.  Increasing the ghost level results in the background 
being subtly, then significantly, perturbed by the fractal.  The disturbance 
starts with the highest iteration levels first (except that interior points 
are assigned 0 iteration, to clarify the boundary), and propagates to the 
lower iterations as the ghostliness is increased.  The effect on the image 
is to see the background gradient smoothly displaced by the fractal, but 
to not see the fractal directly.

The best uses of this scheme seems to be on Julia dust (non-connected) 
fractals, in which there is lots of "empty" space for the background to 
show through.

Field

In the Mandelbrot set, field lines are roughly perpendicular to the
dwell bands (bands of constant escape iteration number).  The lines
are not directly related to the iteration level, nor to the
decomposition rays, but are associated with the behavior of the orbits
as the iterates approach infinity.  Field lines of period "n" separate
the period n disks from the main cardioid of the Mandelbrot set.  The
points that make up these lines have the characteristic that, as the
magnitude of the orbit approaches infinity, the polar angle is

fieldangle = 2 * pi * m / (2^n - 1),

where n is the period of the line, and m = (1, 2, ... 2^n-1) is the
order of the line.

For example, there are 3 period 2 field lines, for m = 1, 2, and 3.
(The m=3 case is simply the positive real axis, whose fieldangle is
always 0.)  For m=1, the fieldangle = 2/3 pi radians, or 120 degrees.
Each successive iteration squares the previous iterate (neglecting
adding c, since c is very small relative to the iterate), which doubles
the fieldangle.  Twice 120 degrees is 240 degrees, or 4/3 pi radians.
Twice that is 8/3 pi radians, or 2/3 pi radians (since 6/3 pi radian
or 2 pi is a full circle).  So, the field line has the same angle again
in 2 iterations, or is periodic with period n=2.  The same thing happens
with the m=2 line.

Finding the field lines directly is not an easy task.  What this coloring
method does is to show approximations to the field lines, and show some
cases that aren't field lines at all.  It does this by computing the
polar angle of the iterate at each step, and comparing it to the angle
for the user-specified field line.  By coloring according to the smallest
error in angles (current vs. field line), lines are drawn that come close
to the specified field line.  (For the actual field line, the error would
be zero.)  However, many other lines have polar angles equal to that of
the specified field line, so they show up as well.  The result is not
necessarily a mathematically accurate illustration of the Mandelbrot
field lines, but it is another interesting way to render the set.

Gauss

In the Fractint method bof60, the question of interest is how close
the orbit comes to the origin (0+0i).  The origin is one of an infinity
of "Gaussian integers."  These are complex numbers such that both the
real and imaginary parts are integers.  Examples are:  (0,0), (-2,3),
(17,-5), and (1000000,123456789).  The gaussian scheme is concerned with
how close the orbit comes to a Gaussian integer.

To find the gaussian integer which the orbit most closely approaches,
the built-in function round() is used.  Round(zc) returns a complex
number whose components are the rounded components of zc.  This is a
Gaussian integer.  The distance from zc to round(zc) is simply the
magnitude of zc - round(zc).  The gaussian method tracks this distance
and records the value of zc for which the distance is the smallest.
This value of zc is zmin.

In the gaussintt methods (Julia and Mandelbrot variations), simply plots
the polar angle of zmin, by assigning zmin to z and using the decomp
coloring.  Since zmin can occur at any point in the orbit, there's no
clear connection between the pixel value and the resulting color.
However, nearby points can often have similar orbits, so the spots of
constant color (polar angle) can have a variety of sizes.  Similar
results are obtained with the gaussintr methods.  Here, the log of the
magnitude of zmin is used as the polar angle for decomposition.

For particular combinations of parameter c and initial zc, the orbit
may be all Gaussian integers, for example, starting with zc=1 and c =
(0,1).  For other combinations of zc and c, such as zc=0 and c=pi,
the orbit will never be an integer.  Thus, it is reasonable to assume
that some orbits will tend to be closer to integers than others.  This
is illustrated with the gaussinttot methods.  A running sum of the
distances, r, is kept for all iterations in the orbit.  The mean
distance is then determined, and this is scaled into the decomposition
angle.  The result is a grid-like pattern superimposed on the basic
fractal structure.

Range

In the range coloring schemes, the pixels of the Julia set images
are only colored when the iterate (of a component of it) falls within
a specified range.  This is similar to the bubble method, which only
treats orbits that pass close to the origin.  With an appropriate
choice of parameters, the range schemes can be forced to generate
bubbles-type images.  However, the intent of the range method was
to render Julia sets through thin rings of color, using a relatively
small range of magnitudes in which to trap the orbit.

The simplest case is shown in the range-r formulas.  Here, the orbit
is monitored until the magnitude of the iterate falls within a
specified range.  When this occurs, that iterate is saved.  Upon
bailout (either escape or maximum iterations), the last iterate
falling within the range is recalled, and its polar angle shown via
decomposition coloring.  Depending on the range chosen, the results
can be circular rings, pinched loops (figure "8"), or open loops.
The shapes are definitely non-fractal, but are assembled in such a
way to recover the underlying fractal structure.

Choosing the range is very important, as a greatly impacts the image.
The most direct route is to simply specify the upper and lower bounds
of the range.  This is the method used in range-r, and can require a
great deal of thought, to coordinate a range with the Julia parameter.
The other formulas using this method adust the ranges depending on the
Julia parameter c.  The range parameters are set by the user, the
center and the width.  For example, choosing a center of 1.0 and a
width of 0.1 means that the range will extend from 0.95 to 1.05, half
the width either side of the center.  The value of the center depends
on the the formula chosen.  In range-r-1, the basis for the range is
|c|, so the above choices would result in a range from 95% |c| to
105% |c|.  This basis was chosen since c is the first iterate of 0
(0^2 + c = c), and zero is the critical point of z^2 + c.  Another
way of looking at it is that, by choosing a range centered around c,
the orbit of 0 will fall into the range on the first iteration.  The
formulas range-r-2 and -3 use the second and third iterations,
respectively, so their bases are |sqr(c)+c| and |sqr(sqr(c)+c)+c|.  

This method opens itself up to many variations.  For example, instead
of monitoring the magnitude of the iterate, the real or imaginary
components can be tracked.  The formulas range-x and range-y perform
this.  In range-x, the real part of the iterate is watched.  When it
falls into the target range, the imaginary part of the iterate is
scaled and used as the decomposition angle.  Range-y does the same
thing, switching the roles of the real and imaginary parts.  Each is
offered with the 4 above range setting options:  explicit, c, sqr(c)+c,
sqr(sqr(c)+c)+c (the formulas are named similar to the range-r entries,
substituting -x or -y as appropriate).

Each of the above formulas uses the last occurance of an iterate inside
the target range to color the pixel.  If the orbit is such that the
range is hit many times, that prior information is lost.  One manner to
recover part of that information is with the rangecount formulas.  The
basic setup is the same as the range formulas, but now the decomposition
angle is the count of how many times the orbit landed in the range.  A
scale factor is available to convert the count into a useable angle.
This method seems to work especially well when the range width is
increased, to increase the hit count and make more colors available.

; 
; A few days ago, I posted an article in response to a question about the
; connections between the Farey sequence and the Mandelbrot set.  Since
; then, I've found a few other connections, which I'll discuss here.
; 
; Recall that the Farey sequence is a way to order the fractions m/n, where
; m and n are postive integers and have no common factors (like 1/2, 17/101,
; etc.).  Each disk around the main cardioid of the Mandelbrot set is
; tangent to the cardioid at the point corresponding to m/n turns, where 1
; turn = 2 pi radians = 1 full circle.  Specifically, for the m/n disk, the
; tangent point c is located at:
; 
; theta = m/n * 2 * pi radians,
; r = (1 - cos(theta))/2,
; x = r * cos(theta) + 0.25,
; y = r * sin(theta),
; c = x + i*y.
; 
; Also, the m/n disk has periodicity of n.
; 
; The sizes of the disks are also (approximately) determined by the Farey
; number:  the radius of the disk (only the disk at -1 is a true circle, so
; "radius" is used approximately) is
; 
; radius ~ sin (m/n * pi) / n^2.
; 
; For the period 2 circular disk at -1, m/n = 1/2, so the radius formula
; gives sin(pi/2)/4 = 1/4.  Since this disk is a circle, the formula agrees
; with the geometry exactly (the disk stretches from -0.75 to -1.25 on the
; x-axis, so its diameter is 0.5 and its radius is 0.25).  (For the other
; disks, the "center" is defined to be that point in the disk whose orbit
; contains 0, and the "radius" is the distance from this "center" to the
; tangent point.)  This simple formula also describes what happens near the
; cusp.  As n (the period of the disk) increases, the disks get smaller.  In
; the m=1 case (1/2, 1/3, 1/4, etc.), the size of the disk decreases with
; n^3, which is why they seem to disappear into the cusp at 0.25.  Near
; "large" disks, the surrounding disks also get smaller.  For example, look
; near the 1/3 disk at the top of the cardioid.  On either side of it, from
; 2/5 on the left and 1/4 on the right, the disks get smaller as they lead
; up to 1/3.  The m/n * pi factor is about the same, as m/n is approximately 
; 1/3, but again the n^2 in the denominator causes the radius to go to zero
; as n gets large.
; 
; It is well known that a disk of period n has n arms sprouting from the
; branching Misiurewicz point near it.  The M-point for disk 1/2 is near
; -1.54, giving 2 arms, one continuing left out the -x axis to -2, and one
; going right back into the disk.  The M-point near (-0.1,0.96) is
; associated with the 1/3 disk, and has 3 arms.  These arms can be labelled
; by starting with the one coming out of the disk as arm "0" and moving
; clockwise around the M-point.  It appears that, for the m/n disk, the mth
; arm is the arm that "sticks out" the most, or extends furthest from the
; cardioid in a direction normal to the cardioid.  Also, those arms (0 -
; n-1) whose number is a multiple of m seem to be larger than the others.
; These effects can be seen using the attached parameter file.  There are
; zooms on 8 of the period 17 disks around the main cardioid.  (17 was

Root

Complex numbers, of which the real numbers are a subset, all have
two square roots.  That is, for a given complex number a, there
are two numbers, b1 and b2, such that b1*b1 (or b2*b2) = a.  It
so happens that b2 = -b1, since -1 * -1 = 1.  One of these numbers
(typically the one returned by the function sqrt(a)) is termed
the principal square root of a.  For example, if a=9, then the
square roots are 3 and -3.  3 is the principal square root.

For the Mandelbrot and Julia sets, this concept is implemented by
expanding the standard iteration loop.  Instead of:

z_new = z_old * z_old + c, use

w = z_old * z_old
z_new = w + c.

The question is then, is z_old the principal root of w?  This can
be determined by assuming that sqrt(w) returns the principal root.
Then, z_old is compared with sqrt(w) and -sqrt(w), to see which
root of w z_old was.

For the root (_man and _jul) formulas, this is performed on the
last iteration.  The yes/no answer is converted to a binary coloring
of the image.  The rootcount formulas make this determination for
every iteration, incrementing a counter each time z_old was the
principal root.  At the end, the counter is normalized by the total
number of iterations, then scaled into an angle for coloring using
the decomposition method.

Triangle

The triangle method is based on a simple characteristic of complex
numbers:  the magnitude of the sum of two complex numbers, |a+b|,
is strictly limited to a range determined by a and b:

|a+b| >= ||a| - |b||, and
|a+b| <= |a| + |b|,

where |z| is the square root of the sum of the squares of the
components, not the sum of the squares, as in Fractint.  The
extremes of this inequality are easily seen with a few examples.
If a=1 and b=2, then:

|a| = 1, |b| = 2;
||a| - |b|| = |1-2| = |-1| = 1;
|a| + |b| = 1+2 = 3;
|a+b| = |3| = 3;
1 <= 3 <= 3.

The upper bound occurs when both addends have the same polar angle.
The geometric interpretation of this is that the complex numbers add
up, and the length of the sum is simply the sum of the individual
lengths.

The lower bound occurs when the polar angles of the complex numbers
differ by 180 degrees; the two numbers are diametrically opposed.
Then, the length of the sum is the difference of the lengths.  For
example, if a=3i and b=-5i, then:

|a| = 3, |b| = 5;
||a| - |b|| = |3-5| = |-2| = 2;
|a| + |b| = 3 + 5 = 8;
|a+b| = |-2i| = 2;
2 <= 2 <= 8.

In general, the length of the sum is somewhere inbetween, and can be
thought of in terms of a triangle, which is how the inequality gets
its name.  If |a| is the length of one side of a triangle, and |b|
is the length of the second side, then |a+b| is the length of the
third side, and lies somewhere within the range shown above.

Back to fractals.  The two numbers of interest are z^2 and c.  Given
z (the previous iterate) and c (the Mandelbrot or Julia parameter),
the range for the magnitude of the new iterate can then be determined.
With this range, the magnitude of the new iterate can be rescaled to
a fraction between 0 and 1 inclusive:

min = ||z_old^2| - |c||, max = |z_old^2| + |c|,
z_new = z_old * z_old + c
fraction = (|z_new| - min) / (max - min).

This fraction is then scaled into an angle for coloring with the
decomposition method.

In the triang formulas (_man and _jul variations), this operation
is performed on the last iterate.  The triangcount formulas compute
the fraction at every iteration, and color the image based on the
average fraction (over all iterations).

Average

Due to the discrete nature of fractal rendering, most 
fractals exhibit some sort of banding artifacts.  That 
is, formulas tend to be iterated until "something happens", 
and then the pixel is colored.  There can appear a sharp 
border between pixels where the iteration stopped at step 
n, versus nearby pixels that survived until step n+1.  
This discontinuity can even occur if the coloring is based 
on something other than the iteration count.

Averaging is one way to reduce this banding.  The bands of 
color are dependent upon the iteration count, which is 
related to the escape radius, or bailout value.  Changing 
the bailout will move the bands in or out from the fractal, 
and may slightly change their shape.  Moving the bands is 
the basis of this method.

For quadratic formulas (Mandelbrot and Julia sets), squaring 
the bailout will move the bands out approximately one band 
width.  To see this, assume that the orbit escaped at the 
17th iteration, using a escape radius of 100.  The magnitude 
of the iterate is between 100 and 10,000 (or else it would 
have escaped before or after iteration 17).  The magnitude 
of the next iteration will be between 10,000 and 1e8 (100 
squared and 10,000 squared).  Now, changing the escape 
radius to 10,000 (100 squared) means that the orbit will 
escape at the next iteration, or that what was the 17th 
iteration band has moved outward 1 band width.

To see how this works with fractals, assume that a string 
of pixels is colored thusly with a given bailout value:

r g g g b b b

where "r" indicates red, "g" means green, and "b" is 
blue.  Increasing the bailout value moves the band outward, 
giving this string of colors:

r r g g g b b

Averaging the two:

r g g g b b b  first
r r g g g b b  second
r y g g c b b  average

where "y" means dark yellow and "c" means dark cyan.  The 
hard boundary between red and green has now been smoothed 
by the inclusion of a (dark) yellow pixel, and the line 
between green and blue has been smoothed through a (dark) 
cyan pixel.  In reality, more than two bailouts should be 
used to get a smoothly varying image.  Also, when using a 
bit-mapped fractal generator (Fractint), be aware that the 
averaging takes place in color index space, not color space, 
so it is important to use a smoothly varying color map.

The "ave8template" formula shows the basic functionality, 
using 8 different bailouts.  Call the lowest bailout r1, 
and choose it such that it is much larger than the size 
of the parameter (say, 100).  Then the width of this 
iteration band is from 100 to 10,000.  That is, all orbits 
that escape will have magnitudes between 100 and 10,000.  
The goal is to pick several other bailout values that will 
equally span this space.  Since the high end of the range 
is r1^2 or r1*r1^1, 8 even steps can be made by choosing 
bailouts of

r = r1 * r1^(i/8), 

for i from 1 to 8.  In practice, r1 and the next 7 steps 
are used, since the eighth bailout will overlap the first 
one.  Given the bailout values, 8 different iteration 
flags are initialized to 0.

At each iteration, the overall iteration counter is 
incremented, and an overall variable is recorded, which 
tracks the relevant quantity (iteration, how many times 
real(z) is less than imag(z), etc.).  Checking for escape 
is doing by sequentially stepping through the 8 bailout 
values.  If bailout 1 is exceeded, then set iteration 
counter 1 to the current iteration and set variable 1 
to the value of the overall variable.  If all the 
bailouts have not yet been exceeded, continuing iterating.

When all the bailouts have been exceeded, compute the 
average of all the specific variables (variable 1, variable 
2, etc.).  Then, use that average as the coloring parameter.  
If the pixel in question turns out the be an inside pixel, 
color using the overall variable.

If the image is to be rendered simply using a smoothed 
iteration count, then a method similar to Linas Vepstas' 
renormalization is preferable.  However, if the variable 
used for coloring does not lend itself to a simple 
renormalization analysis, then the present method will 
work very well.  The number of averages can easily be 
changed to any appropriate amount.  However, when using 
a bit-mapped generator, it will not be beneficial to 
use an extreme number of averages, as the image will 
still be limited to the number of colors available 
in the generator.

Higher order Herman Rings

In Paul Derbyshire's posting about Herman Rings, he gave a formula 
that was known to generate the rings:

H(z) = alpha * z^2 * (z-c) / (1-c*z).

Paul's examples tended to resemble, in overall shape, Julia sets 
from the standard quadratic, f(z) = z^2 + c.  I surmised that this 
was due to the z^2 factor in H(z), and conjectured that higher 
order Herman Rings could be made by increasing the z exponent.  
Just going from z^2 to z^3 was interesting, but didn't result in 
the same sort of dynamics that H(z) had.  So, I generalized H(z)
into F(z):

F(z) = alpha * z^n * g(z)^m, where
g(z) = (z-c)/(1-c*z).

The formula that Paul used had n=2 and m=1.  I tried n=3 and m=1 
and determined it to be unsuccessful.  So, I tried n=3 and m=2, 
and decided that, in general, m should be equal to n-1 for higher 
order rings.

Finding the critical points for F is not as hard as it may seem.  
Using the derivative rules from calculus,

F' = alpha * nz^(n-1) * g^m + alpha * z^n * mg'g^(m-1).

Setting F' = 0 to find the critical points means that alpha,
z^(n-1) and g^(m-1) can all be divided out as common factors.
(The critical points associated with those factors are:  z=0,
z=c, and z=1/c.  None of these has interesting dynamics.)  The
result is:

0 = ng + mg'z, or
z = -ng / (mg').

Differentiating g(z),

g' = (1-c^2) / (1-c*z)^2.

Using this in the above equation for z results in a quadratic
for z which is easily solved using the quadratic equation.  In
fact, when m = n-1, the discriminant of the solution can be
factored.  The result is:

z = [c^2 + (2n-1)] +/- sqrt([c^2 - 1]*[c^2 - (2n-1)^2])] / (2nc).

Using this directly as the starting point for Mandelbrot-type 
images leads to discontinuities, where one root should be used 
instead of the other.  These discontinuities occur when real(c^2) 
= n^2 + m^2, and at the imaginary axis.  In the formulas below
(herman_man and herman-alpha), they are automatically handled
in the initialization.  Since Julia sets are not initialized
using critical points, the herman_jul formulas lack this logic.

The rotation parameter, alpha, is what seems to determine whether 
or not Herman rings actually show up.  Two methods can be used to 
set alpha--cartesian and polar coordinates.  For the cartesian 
method (-cart formulas), the real and imaginary parts of alpha are 
input directly.  With the polar method (-polar formulas), the 
magnitude and polar angle of alpha are input.  This makes it very 
easy to specify rotation by an irrational angle.  Simply specify a 
*rational* number for the polar angle.  The irrationality of the 
rotation angle is expressed as an irrational number of turns, not 
radians.  Since the difference between turns and radians involves 
a factor of pi, which is irrational, using a rational number of 
radians insures that the number of turns is irrational.  The effect
of alpha can be show through the special Mandelbrot-type formula,
herman_alpha.  Here, c is input through parameters and z is
initialized accordingly.  The parameter alpha is varied by being
set to the pixel value.

The following formulas all use the renormalization method to 
reduce banding.  In this implementation, the actual coloring is 
performed using the decomposition method.  This allows separate 
rendering of the orbits that get attracted to infinity and those 
that get attracted to 0.  After forming the decomposition angle 
based on the iteration count, those pixels that escape to infinity 
have their angle increased by pi.  This means that for the same 
iteration count, two pixels with different basins of attraction 
will be separarated by half of the color palette.  Those pixels 
whose orbits are not attracted by either 0 or infinity are treated
as inside pixels.

Variations on Herman Rings

The below formulas are based on the following formula, which is
known to produce Herman rings:

f(z) = alpha * z^2 * (z-c) / (1-c*z).

This can be generalized to:

F(z) = alpha * z^n * g(z)^m, where
g(z) = (z-c) / (1-c*z).

For the case of n >= 2 and m=n-1, it is believed that F(z) will
generate higher order Herman rings.  The present formulas treat
the general case, where m and n are independent.

For the Mandelbrot-type formulas, the critical points of F(z)
are readily determined by solving a quadratic equation.  To
maintain continuity in the image, the selection of critical
must be changed depending on the parameter c.  Otherwise, lines
of discontinuity appear.  These lines are hyperbolic (plus the
imaginary axis), according to (real(c))^2 - (imag(c))^2 = r^2.
This value of r depends on the exponents n and m:

r = (n^2 + m^2) / (n - m)^2.

This adjustment of the critical point is made in the formula
initialization.

The parameter alpha can be selected in two ways, either using
cartesian or polar coordinates.  The advantage to polar coordinates
is that entering an irrational rotation angle is easy; enter a
*rational* polar angle for alpha, and the rotation angle (which
involves a factor of pi) will be irrational.

Five formulas are included:  2 Mandelbrot types (cartesian and
polar), 2 Julia types (cartesian and polar), and 1 Mandelbrot
type where c is explicitly specified and alpha takes on the
pixel value.  For the Mandelbrot types, the choice of critical
point (using either the positive or negative root of the
discriminant) is governed by the sign of real(p3).
