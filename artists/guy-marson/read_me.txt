Date: 13 Mar 2000 02:35:43 +0100

Hi fractinters..

here is a batch (with .frm and 2 .par files) for a little animation,
dedicated to Sylvie Gallet and all the other enthusiasts writing prg's for
fractint.. 

You must use Fractint ver.: 20.0.8 to run this .bat!
Separate the different sections with an editor.
Copy all the sections (of this file) as separate files into your
Fractint-DIR  ..
Run the "minilake.bat" ..
Create the animation with DTA.EXE (ver.2.2)

Enjoy it!


-> rename the different sections as indicated..

->   there must be    a "minilake.bat"
                      a "middle.par"
                      a "startend.par"
-> last but not least a "lake-is.frm"


PS: if somebody is interested in a larger  .BAT, please let me know..

    Cheers, 
    
    Guy Marson
