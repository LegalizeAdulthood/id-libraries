Ghost

In the ghost coloring scheme, you can make the fractal appear or disappear
against a gradient background.  It is based on the iteration smoothing
routine of Linas Vepstas, and uses an adjustable parameter to determine
how prevalent the fractal appears.

The iteration smoothing technique works by letting the iterate go much
beyond the required escape radius of 4, and converting its geometric
growth into a real number.  When combined with the original iteration
number, the result is a real number that can be plotted continuously
with the decomposition (or outside=real) methods.  Here, the smoothed
iteration count is scaled and made the polar angle for the decomposition
coloring.

The backgrounds for these images are gradients (using smooth color maps),
running horizontally, vertically, or in rays from the origin (point 0+0i).
In the latter case, the background is simply the polar angle of the pixel,
which may or may not be centered on the screen, depending on the zoom of
the image.  In the former two cases, the gradients are dynamically set to
use the full color range irrespective of the pixel coordinates.  In any
case, the background is represented by an angle, for use with decomposition.

Given angles for both the iteration count and the background image, they
are combined using the "ghost" parameter.  The iteration angle is scaled
by "ghost" and added to the background angle.  When the ghost level is
set to zero, then only the background angle remains, and that is what is
shown in the image.  Increasing the ghost level results in the background
being subtly, then significantly, perturbed by the fractal.  The disturbance
starts with the highest iteration levels first (except that interior points
are assigned 0 iteration, to clarify the boundary), and propagates to the
lower iterations as the ghostliness is increased.  The effect on the image
is to see the background gradient smoothly displaced by the fractal, but
to not see the fractal directly.

The best uses of this scheme seems to be on Julia dust (non-connected)
fractals, in which there is lots of "empty" space for the background to
show through.
