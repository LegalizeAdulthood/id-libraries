The Bubble Method

The bubble method is an extension of Fractint's bof60 scheme.  In
bof60, the interior of the fractal is colored by how closed the iterate
comes to the origin.  In the bubble method, a specific value is set as
the threshold.  Each step, the magnitude of the iterate is compared to
the threshold.  If the current magnitude is smaller, it becomes the new
threshold level.  The effect is to cover the fractal with "bubbles",
circles the radius of the threshold.  Below a certain threshold value,
the image is a dust of small, disconnected bubbles.  At a particular
theshold value, which varies with the parameter c, the circles all
touch.  Beyond this, the circles squish into each other, like mounds
of soap bubbles.

At bailout, if the image is colored by the last threshold, each bubble
will be filled with rings of concentric circles, representing the range
of minima from the original threshold level down to zero.

Alternatively, the bubbles can be colored by the polar angle of the
iterate, as in the standard Fractint decomposition method.  Here, the
disks become filled with radial lines of color, emminating from the
center of the disk.

The formulas "bubbleboth" (Mandelbrot and Julia variations) combine
the concentric circle and ray colorings.  The magnitude of the final
minimum is scaled into an angle.  This is averaged with the polar angle
of the final iterate, using user-supplied weights.  This allows the
specification of either circles or rays using the same formula.  In
between (for example, using equal amounts of circle and ray) are swirls.
A judicious choice of color map will eliminate the branch cuts that can
be seen with the swirls.
