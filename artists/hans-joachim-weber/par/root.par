Root

Complex numbers, of which the real numbers are a subset, all have
two square roots.  That is, for a given complex number a, there
are two numbers, b1 and b2, such that b1*b1 (or b2*b2) = a.  It
so happens that b2 = -b1, since -1 * -1 = 1.  One of these numbers
(typically the one returned by the function sqrt(a)) is termed
the principal square root of a.  For example, if a=9, then the
square roots are 3 and -3.  3 is the principal square root.

For the Mandelbrot and Julia sets, this concept is implemented by
expanding the standard iteration loop.  Instead of:

z_new = z_old * z_old + c, use

w = z_old * z_old
z_new = w + c.

The question is then, is z_old the principal root of w?  This can
be determined by assuming that sqrt(w) returns the principal root.
Then, z_old is compared with sqrt(w) and -sqrt(w), to see which
root of w z_old was.

For the root (_man and _jul) formulas, this is performed on the
last iteration.  The yes/no answer is converted to a binary coloring
of the image.  The rootcount formulas make this determination for
every iteration, incrementing a counter each time z_old was the
principal root.  At the end, the counter is normalized by the total
number of iterations, then scaled into an angle for coloring using
the decomposition method.
