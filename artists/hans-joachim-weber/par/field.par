Field

In the Mandelbrot set, field lines are roughly perpendicular to the
dwell bands (bands of constant escape iteration number).  The lines
are not directly related to the iteration level, nor to the
decomposition rays, but are associated with the behavior of the orbits
as the iterates approach infinity.  Field lines of period "n" separate
the period n disks from the main cardioid of the Mandelbrot set.  The
points that make up these lines have the characteristic that, as the
magnitude of the orbit approaches infinity, the polar angle is

fieldangle = 2 * pi * m / (2^n - 1),

where n is the period of the line, and m = (1, 2, ... 2^n-1) is the
order of the line.

For example, there are 3 period 2 field lines, for m = 1, 2, and 3.
(The m=3 case is simply the positive real axis, whose fieldangle is
always 0.)  For m=1, the fieldangle = 2/3 pi radians, or 120 degrees.
Each successive iteration squares the previous iterate (neglecting
adding c, since c is very small relative to the iterate), which doubles
the fieldangle.  Twice 120 degrees is 240 degrees, or 4/3 pi radians.
Twice that is 8/3 pi radians, or 2/3 pi radians (since 6/3 pi radian
or 2 pi is a full circle).  So, the field line has the same angle again
in 2 iterations, or is periodic with period n=2.  The same thing happens
with the m=2 line.

Finding the field lines directly is not an easy task.  What this coloring
method does is to show approximations to the field lines, and show some
cases that aren't field lines at all.  It does this by computing the
polar angle of the iterate at each step, and comparing it to the angle
for the user-specified field line.  By coloring according to the smallest
error in angles (current vs. field line), lines are drawn that come close
to the specified field line.  (For the actual field line, the error would
be zero.)  However, many other lines have polar angles equal to that of
the specified field line, so they show up as well.  The result is not
necessarily a mathematically accurate illustration of the Mandelbrot
field lines, but it is another interesting way to render the set.
