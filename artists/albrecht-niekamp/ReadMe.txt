Hi, I`m Albrecht Niekamp, Duesseldorf

This is my first try to publish formulas for the fractint users. These
frm-files correspond to the par-files with the same name. The basic
formula (Nr.13 or 13a) was first used on my Multifrac program for
the good old AtariXL. All other formulas are variations of this one.
Try yourself, You`ll see that they are very easy to edit.

Suggstions, new par-files or variations are welcome.
