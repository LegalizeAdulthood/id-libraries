These are used by permission of the artists. They are for your
personal use. If you wish to make commercial use of the images,
you must contact the individual artists. You can write to them
care of the publisher.

These images are all in 1024 x 768 resolution. You can view them using
Fractint even if your graphics hardware does not support 1024 x 768. 
Just open the files using Fractint's <r> command, and select a video
mode that you know works with your equipment.

In each directory are 640 x 480 GIF files each containing 30 small 
"thumbnail" images of other GIFs in that directory. These thumbnail files 
have names which begin with "0", like "0GFDSK01.GIF" so that they can be 
easily found in Fractint's alphabetical list of files when you use 
the <r> command.

These thumbnail images do not have enough resolution to really see
the fine details in these incredible fractals (because of the low 
resolution, some images may seem unclear). However they are really 
handy for giving you a quick impression of as many as 30 fractals at 
once.

Use the thumbnails as a guide, but don't neglect fractals whose 
thumbnail images don't seem like much. When you see the fractal 
image at its full resolution then the fine texture will become apparent.

2. SOURCE CODE
==============

The complete source code for Fractint. The C and assembler source is
contained in the file FRASRC.EXE.


3. UNIX VERSION OF FRACTINT (XFRACT)
====================================

The source code and executables for the experimental UNIX Xwindows
port of fractint done by Ken Shirriff. (Sorry, the publisher CANNOT SUPPORT 
this product or answer questions about this experimental version of 
Fractint.) XFRACT is supplied as a courtesy bonus to UNIX users. 
You will find Xfract in the \XFRACT directory on this CD. 

We hope you enjoy this CD!
