Included in this zip file are some of my best collections of IFS fractals
for Fractint since 2000.  I work mostly using the Brazil programme, then
render in Fractint.  Almost all of my IFS work uses only one colour map -
Firecode.map, smoothly moving from black to white through red and yellow,
included here.  A useful variation on it is Firecodb, which starts off in
blue instead of black, letting one see the results much faster for an
initial look.  I have also included a reverse-order version of firecode,
called firecodr.map.

I hope to see IFS interest, for even the 2d form, further stimulated as
a result of releasing this work into the world.  There is much remaining
to discover in this type of fractal.
