## 2025.12.31

This release marks the first release where all parameter sets and formula
files have been extensively validated.  The parameter sets were validated
using scripts in this repository and the formulas were all validated using
the formula-validator tool in the
[formula-compiler repository](https://github.com/LegalizeAdulthood/formula-compiler).

### Additions in This Release

#### Libraries
- `artists/hans-joachim-metzger` from `Hans-Joachim_Metzger_PAR_Collection.zip`
  found on Paul N. Lee's site

#### Scripts
- `orphan-formulas.py` get a report of formulas defined but not used in
  parameter sets

## 2025.12.24

Initial release of this collection of libraries.  Sources include a number
of web sites with file scraped from archive.org snapshots.

All entries have been validated by script as far as possible and extraneous
material between file entries commented-out so as to preserve discussion,
commentary, provenance, etc.
