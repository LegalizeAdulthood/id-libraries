ZIP files on that page, when an archived copy existed, were downloaded
and unpacked to create this library.  Index text files were moved to the
index directory.  Files were renamed from 2 digit years to 4 digit years
to make lexical ordering consistent with chronological ordering of the files.

If ZIP files differed, then the newer ZIP file was used.
