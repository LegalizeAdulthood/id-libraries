==========================================================================

For a truly amazing "psychedelic" effect when viewing pictures under MSDOS:

   1) Be sure the disc is using its default viewer (Powerview).  If it
      isn't, use the INSTALL.EXE program to switch to Powerview.

   2) Start up the VIEW program.

   3) Choose a directory that contains images.

   4) Choose a fractal image.

   5) When the fractal image is on your screen, press the "A" key.

This will start Powerview's color cycling feature.  Many of the
fractals will now seem to be moving, shifting, and spiralling on your
screen!

Try some of the following keys:

G ...................... Color-kill on/off (or greyscale)
 
I ...................... Inversion on/off
 
A ...................... Cycle palette on/off (press ESC, a mouse  button,  or
                         "A" to stop cycling)
 
C ...................... Component swap  (cycles  through  all combinations of
                         the RGB components: RGB, RBG, BGR, etc.)
Ctrl+C ................. Component swap reset
 
"1", Shift+"1" ......... Red Component -
"2", Shift+"2" ......... Red Component +
Ctrl+"1", Ctrl+"2" ..... Red Component Reset
 
"3", Shift+"3" ......... Green Component -
"4", Shift+"4" ......... Green Component +
Ctrl+"3", Ctrl+"4" ..... Green Component Reset
 
"5", Shift+"5".......... Blue Component -
"6", Shift+"6" ......... Blue Component +
